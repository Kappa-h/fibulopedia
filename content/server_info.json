  "additional_info": "Project Fibula is a recreation of early Tibia's spirit, with certain features from future versions introduced where necessary to make it stable, fair, and engaging for a modern audience. The game has been designed to feel like early Tibia in many ways; however, it is not an exact replica.\n\nEach phase of the project revisits a chapter of Tibia's evolution, exploring how the game's world, balance, and mechanics changed over time.\n\nThe server is powered by The Violet Project - a closed-source, forked version of The Forgotten Server - which has been designed to emulate as many classic features of Tibia as possible."
